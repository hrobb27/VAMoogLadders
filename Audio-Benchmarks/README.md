The included subfolders in here are the audio renders for each of the filter models.

Each filter was given the same round of benchmark tests. The product of each benchmark is a WAV file. 
They were produced in Max by recording a 5 second filter sweep with different parameters.
The audio sources were an electronic loop made in VCV Rack (included as MoogFodder.wav in the parent folder), white noise, and a 40hz bandlimited square wave

The parameters used in each benchmark are listed in the file name. It should be noted that the resonance parameter has no universal definition between each filter model.
The resonance was roughly scaled so that for most of these sweeps, the resonance does not "cap out" and do nothing for a majority of the file.
Due to the nonlinearity of the resonance, the strength and pitch of the resonant peak is dependent on the volume of the input.

Each folder includes, for each input source, a render with a gain of 1, 1/4, and 4. These renders are in two batches, one with a resonance of 1, and one with a resonance of 0.
For the musical input, a gain of 100 is used to demonstrate the distortion of the filter's nonlinearities. The white noise input includes a gain of 0.0001 due to the sensitivity of some filters.

Some spectrograms were created in PNG format using Sonic Visualizer
